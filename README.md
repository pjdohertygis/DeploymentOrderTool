# Deployment Order Tool (DOT)
This is a web mapping application used to find the nearest Urban Search and Rescue Team to an incident point of arrival. 

This application is currently used by FEMA US&R Branch staff to determine the closest Task Force based on trucking distance and/or travel time. It can be adapted for other purposes but the intended audience for the core application is the FEMA US&R Branch only. For more information on this project, contact the author.
